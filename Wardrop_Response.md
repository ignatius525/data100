# Wardrop Response

  The Wardrop article describes two different methods for collecting and interpreting data for human development. The first approach is the top-down method, a method which has been used for many years and would be considered the "traditional method". National census results are combined with geo-spatial data colleceted by GIS and other satelliate systems to create accurate high-resolution spatial grids to display different trends in human development. This is the most accurate method, but can be very hard to implement due to human conflicts and financial hardships. Collecting census data is expensive and can be inaccurate at times. A LMIC can have a hard time collecting all data necessary to create an accurate data pool, as not all areas of the country might be reached. Additionally, wars and socioeconomic conflicts can interfere with data collection, resulting in significant chunks of the population being missed out. This is where the bottoms-up approach can be used to estimate trends without reaching the entire population such as in a census. The bottoms-up method collects data from small chunks of the population (microcensus counts), and then use that data to estimate trends for areas that are harder to reach, either due to war or financial strain. When a full census is not possible, the bottoms up approach can help subsidize with relativiely accurate estimates. But again, this is an estimate and not the most accurate way of creating geo-spatial data sets for human development. The main issue is that microcensus estimations cannot take into account socioeconomic and other attributes of a different area, something that a census can account for. Estimations can get pretty close, but will never be 100% accurate, mainly because socioeconomic data cannot be interlaid the data that is being estimated for. Landscan is an early example of the top-down method, which used land cover and distances to major road networks to correlate population density. The bottoms-up approach is being used to map the population of Afghanistan, which was been torn apart by war in the past 30 years, and many areas are still very hard to reach. Overall, the top-down method is still the better method, but due to costs of running a census and other conflicts, the bottoms-up approach is a very good substitute for when the top-down method is impossible to complete.
