  The methodology presented attempts to create a solution that is scalable: one that can be used to collect and process data at high scale, while also being able to zoom is to a high resolution, such as 100m x 100m tiles. Researchers also used dissagreggation techniques that allow for specific data sets to be pulled from a large aggregated data set. Rasters are used to grid-like data sets, in which each apportionment of the raster is assigned a coordinate set to help identify it amonsgt the raster. In this proposition, researchers create a system in which they overlay several different data sets, including GADM and GIS data to create the WorldPop set. Sets with uniform distribution and proportionate allocation will be used. For example, the administrative borders will be using unifrom distribtution to be displayed, as there is not a different density of border, unless also plotting administrative subdivisions, in which different density borders could be used. Proportionate allocation can be used to display variations within each of the raster sets being used. This method will be an improvement to a traditional census, as it will be easier to identify trends within society and correlations that can be used to help solve problems of the future.
