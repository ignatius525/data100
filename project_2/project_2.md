  These first three graphs are histograms combined with a distribution curve that best estimates the dependent factor based on the independent data. The first graph is the density of the population based on urban cover. The second graph is the density of the population based on night-time lights. The last graph is the density of the population based on the logarithm of the population. The last graph should have the most accurate predictor as it is making a model based directly on a population statistic.
