### Part 1: Urban Areas in Yalta
![](project_3_part_1.png)
  In this first part of the project, we were asked to find urbanized areas in some administrative subdiviion of our lmic. I chose Yalta, the site of one of the meetings between the big three near the conclusion of World War II. In my final effort, I was only able to produce one urbanized location according to my data. However, this area is quite small and is almost populated equally throughout, thus only producing one area that seems "urbanized", compared to the rest. For the future, I will try to use a larger area subdivision with a similar population, so that I can display more urbanized areas compared to the rest.
