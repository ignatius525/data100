1. The technique described in the Stevens article is called the "Random Forest" technique. In basic terms, the algorithm takes in minimal parameters, such as population density and other covariates, and creates many regression trees to create the best possible predicition of geospatial data for a certain area.

2. A machine learning algorithm is one that gets better and better at doing its job over time. Initially, the algorithm might be good at making predicitions, but with every consecutive completion of the algorithm it will get better at creating an even more accurate model based on the data passed on as parameters. In the past, machine-learning methods were not commonly used in data science: however, with the rapidly developing world, it will become necessary to be able to predict the future with a greater degree of accuracy.

3. Land cover, census, raster-formats, and vector-formats are all used as different covarities in the data set. All of these different types of variables represent a significant chunk of the data set, but definetely not all. The advantage of the random tree method is that this method uses less covariates as parameters and can predict future trends with a smaller amount of input.

4. Many LMIC's are plagued by poor resource distribution within its borders. People who are not included in population distributions are the ones who end up being the most in need since they do not have the resources that others do. This tends to be due to LMIC's not having enough funding to pursue such endeavors of a census and population mapping. This increased accuracy will improve resoruce distribution in LMIC's.

5. Ukraine has recently undergone civil strife in the eastern part of the country. Ukraine is also heavily influenced by resources provided by Russia to the east. Russian has a very strong grip on Ukraine and does not want to let go. Improved census collecting will allow for international organizations and the Ukrainian government redistrubute resources more efficiently.
